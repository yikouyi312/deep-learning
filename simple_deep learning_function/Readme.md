* Autograd
* a framework that allows us to calculate the derivatives of any arbitrarily complex mathematical function.
  - forward accumulation, computes the derivatives of the chain rule from inside to outside
  - reverse accumulation, computes the derivatives of the chain rule from outside to inside
*  Autograd framework keeps track of the sequence of operations that are performed on the input data leading up to the final loss calculation. It then performs backpropagation and calculates all the necessary gradients.
